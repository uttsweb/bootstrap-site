                    <h2>Top 6 ways you can stop climate change</h2>
                    <p>The onset of climate change has come about following over 200 years' worth of unchecked manmade activity that's had a negative impact on the world around us - from deforestation and the burning of fossil fuels to driving cars or throwing away perfectly useable materials.</p>
                    <p>While we can't undo the damage caused to the environment, we can help decelerate the rate of change - and long-term, change the fate of the planet altogether. Half the problem for us as individuals, however, is the knowing where to start.</p>
                    <p>To help you get to grips with climate change, we've identified several key areas we should all be addressing in our day to day lives to help you get started. We hope you'll find that becoming more environmentally friendly isn't as difficult as you might think!</p>

            <div class="well well-sm"><h3>Be energy efficient</h3>
            <p>You already switch off lights — what's next? Change light bulbs to compact fluorescents or LEDs. Unplug computers, TVs and other electronics when not in use. Wash clothes in cold or warm (not hot) water.</p>

            </div>

            <div class="well well-sm"><h3>Eat wisely</h3>
            <p>Buy organic and locally grown foods. Avoid processed items. Grow some of your own food. And eat low on the food chain — at least one meat-free meal a day — since 18 per cent of greenhouse gas emissions come from meat and dairy production.
                Food writer Michael Pollan sums it up best: "Eat food. Not too much. Mostly plants."</p>

            </div>

            <div class="well well-sm"><h3>Trim your waste</h3>
            <p>Garbage buried in landfills produces methane, a potent greenhouse gas. Keep stuff out of landfills by composting kitchen scraps and garden trimmings, and recycling paper, plastic, metal and glass. Let store managers and manufacturers
                know you want products with minimal or recyclable packaging.</p>

            </div>

            <div class="well well-sm"><h3>Fly less</h3>
            <p>Air travel leaves behind a huge carbon footprint. Before you book your next airline ticket, consider greener options such as buses or trains, or try vacationing closer to home. You can also stay in touch with people by videoconferencing,
                which saves time as well as travel and accommodation costs.</p>

            </div>

            <div class="well well-sm"><h3>Green your commute</h3>
            <p>Transportation causes about 25 per cent of Canada's greenhouse gas emissions, so walk, cycle or take transit whenever you can. You'll save money and get into better shape! If you can't go car-free, try carpooling or car sharing, and
                use the smallest, most fuel-efficient vehicle possible.</p>

            </div>

            <div class="well well-sm"><h3>Support and Donate</h3>
            <p>Many organizations, including the Green ECO, are working hard on solutions to climate change and rely on financial support from citizens like you. Consider making a donation today by calling 1-800-000-000 or by visiting our secure
